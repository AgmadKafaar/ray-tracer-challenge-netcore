# The Ray Tracer Challenge... in .NET Core

This repo holds the code for a ray tracer following this book: [The Ray Tracer Challenge - A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/)

## Technologies used

I'm implementing the code of the ray tracer with the following technlogies:

 * .NET Core 2.2
 * C#
 * xUnit and possibly SpecFlow (the .NET version of cucumber... but not sure it work very well with VS Code)
